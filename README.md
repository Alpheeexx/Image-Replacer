# Image-Replacer

Ever looked at a site and wished that you could see your favorite memes while you browse? Image replacer (tries to) replace (mostly) all images on a website with those of your choosing 

To specify the images which are replaced edit the replace.js. The variable pictures is an array. If your not sure how to use arrays follow this link [https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp "https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp")

If only one image url is specified all images will be replace with that one
