# Image-Replacer

To specify the images which are replaced edit the replace.js. The variable pictures is an array. If your not sure how to use arrays follow this link [https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp "https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp")

If only one image url is specified all images will be replace with that one
